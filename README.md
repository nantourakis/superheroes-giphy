Enter your favorite superhero into the user input box, your input then gets pushed into an array from which it creates buttons in the HTML. Clicking on a button grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate.
If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
With every gif is displayed its rating (PG, G, etc.).

GIPHY is an animated GIF search engine. The GIPHY API is a series of JSON read endpoints that allow you to integrate the features of GIPHY's search engine into your project or app.

Technologies Used
